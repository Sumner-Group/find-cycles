# find-cycles
This is python/Jupyter Notebook code that utilizes the NetworkX package (https://networkx.github.io/) to locate cyclic structures within an MD simulation. Specifically, it was written to find cyclical N-mers in an MD simulation of liquid methanol. However, it should work for any hydrogen-bonding solvent.
